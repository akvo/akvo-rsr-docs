.. Description of the mail service we use and the options that are available to users.

AkvoMail refers to all email addresses within the domain @akvo.org. This is a mail domain which is hosted on an internal server that sits in Stockholm alongside our Web and Development Servers.

If you will be receiving an @akvo.org email address this will be setup by someone assigned the Email MGMT roles. The list of people with this role can be found here: :ref:`roles`.

.. _Webmail:

Webmail
-------

The Webmail service for AkvoMail is offered in combintation with Zimbra_, and can be accessed via mail.outbox.se_

Your username is your full email address and your password will be supplied to you by the same person who gives you your mail address.

E.g. name@akvo.org & password1

You should change your Password upon first login by going to the Preferences/Voorkeuren section.

Mail Client
-----------

AkvoMail can also be used with any Mail Client that supports IMAP - e.g. Apple Mail, Outlook, Thunderbird & Smartphone Mail Clients.

To setup with your Mail Client you need to add a new Account using the following details:

Username: Full Email Address e.g. name@akvo.org
Password: Same as Webmail - please change your password in Webmail BEFORE setting up a mail client.

Incoming Mail Server (IMAP): mail.outbox.se

The Outgoing Mail Server DOES require authentication and it should use the same settings as the Incoming Server.
